# Speculative Decoding

This repository is a pytorch implementation of Speculative Decoding / Speculative Sampling ([Leviathan et al., 2023](#1);[Chen et al., 2023](#2)).
It contains the code for two generation strategies: classic auto-regressive decoding and speculative decoding. Both of these generation strategies can be used in a greedy or nucleus sampling (temperature, top k and top p) setting.

## What is Speculative Decoding?

Speculative Decoding is a decoding strategy for transformers that allows to generate sequences faster than the classic auto-regressive decoding without changing the output distribution or requiring further fine-tuning. It uses a smaller, more efficient approximation model (called a "drafter") to generate speculative token prefixes. These prefixes are then evaluated in parallel by the larger target model, reducing the number of serial decoding steps required and leading to inference speedups.

The core process rely on the specific behavior of the Transformer model that allows to compute the probability distribution of all the fed in tokens. This distribution is then used to verify the drafts generated by the drafter model.

### 1. Generate text using Speculative Decoding

#### a. Load the target and drafter model

The target model is the transformer model we want to accelerate, while the drafter model is the smaller model that will be used to generate drafts to the target model.

Here are some requirements to make speculative decoding work:
- The target model must be a transformer model (decoder only).
- The drafter model must share the same tokenizer as the target model.
- The target model and the drafter model should output same shape logits.
- The target model should be large enough to benefit from the acceleration. (causing a bottleneck in memory)
- The drafter model should be small enough to be faster than the target model.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# We will use the Google Gemma 7B Instruct as the model we want to accelerate (7B parameters)
target_model_name = "google/gemma-7b-it"
target = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(target_model_name)

# We will use the Google Gemma 2B Instruct as the drafter model (2B parameters)
drafter_model_name = "google/gemma-2b-it"
drafter = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(drafter_model_name)

# Don't forget to load the tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(target_model_name)
```

#### b. Prepare the input

Before generating text, we need to prepare the input. The input should be tokenized and encoded using the tokenizer.

```python
prefix = "Translate to English: Je m'appelle Romain. N'hésitez pas à contribuer à mon projet !"

chat_templated = f"<bos><start_of_turn>user\n{prefix}<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n" # Gemma chat template
input_ids = tokenizer(chat_templated, return_tensors="pt").input_ids
input_ids = input_ids[0].tolist() # Generation methods require a list of ids
```

#### c. Generate text

Speculative Decoding uses one hyperparameter: $\gamma$, the number of drafts generated by the drafter model at each step. 

Increasing the value of $\gamma$ will not always lead to a faster generation, as the drafts may be rejected more. The acceptance rate $\alpha$ is the number of drafts accepted by the target model divided by the number of drafts generated. The higher the acceptance rate, the faster the generation. So the idea is to find the ideal $\gamma$ according to the acceptance rate in order to get the fastest generation.

```python
from sampling import speculative_generate, autoregressive_generate
from utils.logits_processors import NucleusProcessor

# Parameters
gen_len = 100       # Maximum number of tokens generated (could over pass when using speculative decoding)
gamma = 4           # Number of drafts generated by the drafter model at each step
logits_processor = NucleusProcessor(temperature=.6, top_p=.9) # Nucleus sampling with p=0.9 and T=0.6

# Generate text using the classic auto-regressive decoding (slow)
output_ids_ar = autoregressive_generate(
                input_ids,
                target,
                logits_processor=logits_processor,
                max_gen_len=gen_len,
                end_tokens_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
                pad_token_id=tokenizer.pad_token_id,
            )
output_ar = tokenizer.decode(output_ids_ar, skip_special_tokens=True)

# Generate text using the speculative decoding (faster)
output_ids_sd, alpha = speculative_generate(
                input_ids,
                drafter,
                target,
                tokenizer,
                logits_processor=logits_processor,
                gamma=gamma,
                max_gen_len=gen_len,
                end_tokens_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
                pad_token_id=tokenizer.pad_token_id,
            )
output_sd = tokenizer.decode(output_ids_sd, skip_special_tokens=True)

print("Auto-regressive decoding:", output_ar)
print("Speculative decoding:", output_sd)
print("Acceptance rate:", alpha) # Number of drafts accepted by the target model divided by the number of drafts generated
```

### 2. Run console interface Inference

You can run `infer.py` in your console to generate text using the console interface. You can easily change the hyperparameters of the generation, compare target and speculative generation, enable drafter generation and much more.

```bash
python infer.py
```

To change the models used, you can change the `target_model_name` and `drafter_model_name` in the `infer.py` file.
